Goal:  For people to buy gaming products in a simple way

Feedback Questions: 
1.	Do the pictures demonstrate a good understanding of what my website is selling?
2.	Is the description of the products too long?
3.	Does the website look organized?

Hypothesis: Will the user be able to find the products in a simple way?

Accept or reject your hypothesis?
I accept the hypothesis. The feedback I received was making some of the product description shorter and grammar on the product descriptions. Possibly change the website logo. Put a title on the slide show at the top of the page for the popular products. 

Feedback I applied to my site:
1.	Instead of having everything the website features together and separate I made different sections. 

2.	Change my website logo and added a tagline underneath.

3.	Making the carousel have a title of Popular items instead of people trying to guess the purpose of it. The Carousel also utilizes json.
